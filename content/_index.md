description: "Upward mantle flow from novel seismic observations"

While downward mantle flow (subduction) is well constrained, a grand challenge in Earth sciences is to understand mid-plate, deep upward flow that cannot be explained by plate tectonics. The aim of the UPFLOW project, funded by the European Research Council (2021-2026) is to develop an entirely new seismic imaging approach and to use it to constrain plume-like mantle upwellings at unprecedented resolution. Upward flow is critical for continental growth, for returning volatiles to the atmosphere and for producing Earth's largest melting events. These events coincide with major extinctions, supercontinent breakups and with changes in geodynamo behaviour.
