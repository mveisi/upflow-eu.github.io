We are thrilled that the first OBS of the UPFLOW project has been deployed! This is a NAMMU instrument from the iMARL pool of instruments from the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS), Ireland. Her name is Monega, which is the name of a primary school in Forest Gate, East London, that participated in our "ship-to-classroom" UPFLOW workshops organised by UCL's GeoBus. 

See you in a year, Monega, we look forward to unravelling your recordings!
