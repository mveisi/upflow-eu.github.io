We are getting ready to recover the 50 OBSs deployed in summer 2021.

On August 3rd we will leave harbour, sailing from Lisbon to the Azores-Madeira-Canary islands region to collect all the 50 OBSs deployed in July-August 2021. In the meantime, we are working on all the final preparations (ensuring that all the kit needed for the instruments' recovery arrives to the ship on time, preparing data processing and analysis tools, finalising travel arrangements, cruise plans, etc etc). Watch this space as we approach the departure date!
