The Mario Ruivo ship has left harbour of Ponta Delgada to start the second leg of our OBS deployment mission. This part will bring us towards the southern part of the research area, around Madeira and the region towards the Canary archipelago. Due to the great weather conditions during the first leg, we are now comfortably ahead of schedule and the forecast so far is looking good again.
