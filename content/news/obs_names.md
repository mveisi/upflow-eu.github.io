summary: "Our instruments have been named"
---

We asked children up to 12 years old to submit names for our OBS instruments.  We received a bunch of cool names and chose our favourites.  With the first deployments imminent, we have announced our [list of winners]({{< ref "outreach/adopt.md" >}})!  Thank you to all the kids who submitted suggestions, and also checkout some of their [drawings]({{< ref "outreach/draw.md" >}})!
