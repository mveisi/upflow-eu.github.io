We have successfully deployed all 46 ocean-bottom seismometers, and on top of that we are well ahead of schedule! Good weather and excellent work from the [ship crew]({{< relref "experiment/team#Ship" >}}) have allowed us to return to Lisbon about a week early for some well-earned rest.  With four other OBSs deployed in late June by GEOMAR, we reached our target of 50 OBSs in the Azores-Madeira-Canary islands region! We will return in a year's time to fish out the instruments and start looking at the data!
