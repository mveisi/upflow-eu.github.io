We had two very successful ocean bottom seismometer campaigns in July-August 2021 (deployment of 50 OBSs) and in August-September 2022 (recovery of 49 OBSs) on the Research Vessel MÃ¡rio Ruivo. Check out where the RV MR is now using the live tracker below, and check out our blogs and videos to learn more about our expeditions!
