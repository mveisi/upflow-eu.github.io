summary: "The beauty of the 'mar chao'"
---
From the very first day on board of the RV Mario Ruivo, I'm totally amazed by the sea and its beauty! Icould spend ours looking over the eternal sea, everytime I think I have seen 'enough', I recognize a tiny, but amazing difference of the sea compared to the days, an hour, or even a minute before.
Depending on the daytime and weather, the sea reveals all shades of blue, from luscious deep blue over light turquois, white crests, greyish blue, silver to rosy and golden. No matter, if the sea is calm, or more in movement, its power is fascinating!
In 'Thea at Sea', I invite you to enjoy the beauty of the sea!
The first days we experienced the 'mar ch√¢o', a super flat and beatifuly calm sea. Amazingly the color of the ocean changed during the day.

Whereas the sky and the sea appeared bright bluish in the morning, before sunrise, it changed to a more greyish color during the sunrise. During the day, the sea became even calmer, it was like looking over a hughe mirror. You could nearly not tell where the sea ends and the sky begins. The sea was again deep blue, but reflecting the clouds on the sky and the light. 
Later, in the evening, the sea was again more greyish.
