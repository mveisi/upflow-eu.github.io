summary: "The beauty of the 'mar ch칙o'"
---
From the very first day on board of the *RV M치rio Ruivo*, I'm totally amazed by the sea and its beauty! I could spend hours looking over the eternal sea, there is always a fascinating detail or tiny, but amazing difference of the sea compared to the days, hours, or even minutes before.

Depending on the daytime and weather, the sea shows all shades of blue, from deep blue over light turquois, greyish blue to silver, rosy and golden. No matter, if the sea is calm, or more wavey its steady movement and power is fascinating!


In 'Thea at Sea', I invite you to enjoy the beauty of the sea with me!
The first days we experienced the so called 'mar ch칙o', a uper flat and beatifuly calm sea. Amazingly the color of the ocean changed during the day.

Whereas the sky and the sea appeared bright bluish before sunrise, it changed to more greyish during the sunrise. {{< figure src="/blogs/Marchao1.png" caption=" Sea around sunrise." >}}
Later, the sea became even calmer, it was like looking over an huge mirror. You could nearly not tell where the sea ends and the sky begins.

From the deep blue by day, the color changed to more greyish-silver to finally rose and golden during the sunset.
