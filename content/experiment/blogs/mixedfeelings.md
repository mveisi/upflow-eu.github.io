Being in a research cruise is a really special, unique experience. Our time schedule is driven by the project's specificities (e.g., OBS instruments that need to be deployed at specific times, day and night) and space may be constantly shared with strangers with very diverse backgrounds. It feels like being in a very distinct space-time world that we invented but that eventually took its own command. Focus is high (well, mostly), to make sure that all tasks are properly done and to ensure that everything goes well for everyone. Friendships and bonds naturally develop and everyone quickly understands that cooperation is key for a positive experience - never the expression "we are all in the same boat" made so much sense to me.

Before coming to the cruise I was a bit worried about being stuck in a moderate size ship in the middle of the ocean - claustrophobia and isolation were often in my mind. Being a mum of two young kids, lots of family stuff had to be prepared pre-cruise (timetables, clothes, family travelling arrangements, who waters the plants, school holidays,...). I could not stop asking myself whether it was all worth it, not to mention the separation anxiety of being away from the kids for such a long time for the first time. The older kid kept asking if the ship would sink and the baby decided (again!) that I was the only one that could put him down to bed just a few days before I was due to depart... no pressure!

Of course the amazing science ahead makes it totally worth it. But it's more than that. Change, much-needed change after over a year of a pandemic. Having showers without a small person audience and having time for proper teeth brushing and for uninterrupted, calm chats were all distant memories. This cruise allowed me to break out (at least temporarily!) from an exhausting, auto mode that I hadn't even realised that I had embraced.

Group meals, joint work, more or less personal chats and even dancing brought an amazing feeling of "normality" that I hope that will come back fully to our normal daily lives soon. I was also lucky to have an unforgettable birthday, including a fun baptism organised by our great crew and the most incredible surprise ship-shaped cake, fully equipped with a carrot cake lobster OBS made by the team and crew. There were also several serious logistics problems, which eventually got sorted. But despite all the stress, there was always someone to talk to, reflect and decompress, and we even spontaneously formed an UPFLOW women's group that talked through all those painful topics that often go under the carpet (yes: periods, miscarriages, elderly parents, ...).

I left leg 1 with a ginormous lump in my throat. I couldn't wait to hug the kids, but I also wished that I could stay until the end. The power of the next OBS diving into the deep water, the stimulating science meetings, the warm sea breeze at the end of the day, the dolphin(g)s and whales, posting a postcard in the Selvagens (no, team, no way!), watching an online jazz gig together. But, most importantly, continuing to share this fantastic experience with such amazing people, being part of the adventure. I feel incredibly lucky and privileged to have lived with you and have shared so many intense moments in the last couple of weeks. Thank you everyone! I will entusiastically follow the adventures of leg 2 team, and with a dash of jealousy!
