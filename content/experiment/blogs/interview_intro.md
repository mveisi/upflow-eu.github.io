Being together with the same people for many days in a row may be overwhelming. Add to that being onboard of a ship in the middle of the sea, with limited communication to the outside world, and it may be one of the best or one of the worst experiences of your life.
I’ve been participating in scientific cruises since 2014, onboard different ships from a 7 m long inflatable boat to 75 m long research vessels. Regardless of vessel type, I realised that the more open you are, the greater the scientific, professional and personal outcome will be. There will always be unforeseen problems with the equipment. The data will often not be as perfect as you would like, and the sea may be unfriendly in ways that you may not even be able to work. But at the end of the day, you always learn something about your equipment and the value of your data, how to overcome difficulties, and how to deal with each other’s feelings and views. And you keep this experience deep inside you for the rest of your life.

Usually, in each cruise you meet several new people, each one with his own life path and motivation, and it’s always enriching to chat and get to know some of them better. During the UPFLOW cruise we interviewed some members of the crew to know some of the stories of these crucial people, without whom our research could not be conducted. It was a huge pleasure to talk to each of them and share the laughs and tears that are marks of the joy, sadness, motivation and saudade that are behind each action taken at sea.
