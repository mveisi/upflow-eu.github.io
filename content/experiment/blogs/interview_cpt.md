We went ahead and interviewed some of the crew members. This is the first interview out of the series with Captain José Gomes.

Being born in a fishery town, the sea has always played a central role in his life. For generations, men of his family have worked in cod fishing in Norway and Canada. For example, his father worked as an engineer on these ships. 
Captain Gomes studied for four years in the Nautical School Infante Dom Henrique in Paço de Arcos. Before being a Captain, in the 1980s, he worked as Chief Mate on cod fishery ships in Canada and Norway. Depending on the sea conditions, the transit from Portugal to Canada could take between 11 to 23 days. However, the total cruise time was about six months. Captain José Gomes spent most of his career on cargo vessels around the world, especially around Africa.
After retiring, the Captain has never lost his passion for the sea and worked on vessels affiliated to IPMA (Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera – i.e., the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere). Among these are the Noruega and the Mário Ruivo (our vessel). Additionally, he was the first Captain of the brand new, Angolan fisheries research vessel “Baía Farta”. The Captain referred to her as "the big toy” as she was equipped with all kinds of modern and expensive scientific tools.
The Captain thinks of the Mário Ruivo as an old lady. But just like an old lady, she has her particularities and character, which can make it hard to pilot her at times. Refurbishing and renovating her took years, but, in José’s opinion, it was well worth it as the vessel is working well and reliably now.
 Work on a research vessel provides entirely different goals and perspectives compared to the work in cargo ships. Everyday work is often more diverse. For example, the engine often needs to be turned off during experiments, something they never did on cargo ships. All in all, work tends to be less stressful. 

Captain José Gomes is also a passionate photographer. He takes at least one picture of the sea and its ever-changing face every day and, whenever there is some, of the sea life.

Old family traditions dictate that one does not leave to sea on Fridays.

To him, the most memorable experience was piloting the Baía Farta . Second to this is sailing in North Europe and experiencing the sea ice and the extremely cold temperatures. Once their vessel got stuck in the ice so that another ship had to come to rescue them.

During the UPFLOW experiment, Ana and Frederik had daily briefings with captain José Gomes to revise the route and deployment times as needed and discuss any logistics aspects. He and the bridge team kept us informed about the weather forecast and sea state conditions, providing us with regular data logs. Importantly, the UPFLOW team was always welcome to the bridge at any time and the captain even kindly offered his chair to the chief scientist to run the project’s live zoom sessions with schools (link: https://upflow-eu.github.io/experiment/blogs/outreach/ )! The excellent synergy and close relationship between the bridge, the crew and the UPFLOW team were key to the deployment’s success.
