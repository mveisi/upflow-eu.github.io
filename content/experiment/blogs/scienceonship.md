In addition to all the hardworking during the deployment of the OBSs and all the preparation and testing the equipments in the lab, we started a journal club where we have discussed different publications on different geophysical/seismological subjects. Each of us had a chance to present one or two interesting paper(s) and then we all discussed the details and how it can be used later for different approaches in other studies or even in the current project as we will have later some very interesting dataset to work with. This was my first time involving in such a scientific club and I enjoy every single moment of all the fruitful discussions.
