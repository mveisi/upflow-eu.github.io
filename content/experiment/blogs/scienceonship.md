In addition to all the hard work during the deployment of the OBSs and all the preparation and testing the equipment in the lab, we started a journal club where we have discussed different publications on different geophysical/seismological subjects. Each of us had a chance to present one or two interesting paper(s) and then we all discussed the details and how it can be used later for different approaches in other studies, or even in the current project, as we will have later some very interesting data to work with. This was my first time involved in such a scientific club and I enjoy every single moment of all the fruitful discussions.

Since we had some time, Prof. Ana Ferreira tried to simplify the overall picture for the ship crew them and also explain to them how this will help. At the very beginning of our journey, she also gave a brief presentation about the project, all the outcomes, the main objectives and how we can achieve them during the project.
