As part of the collaboration between UPFLOW and [UCL GeoBus](https://www.geobus-london.org.uk/), Amy Edgington - Outreach Leader for the GeoBus - is running workshops with primary schools in London in which students will discover how scientists use waves to discover the deep Earth and ask questions to the scientists live on the research expedition.

During the workshops, the kids built their own model seismometers and designed some cool casings for them! Here are some examples from Greensted Primary School in London.
