summary: "School children name our instruments"

We have asked school children to come up with creative names for our instruments.  We're really excited to see what they will come up with!  When all the submissions are in we will choose our favourites and post them here, so come back later to see if your name was picked!

Some examples we've had so far include Bandberry, Sea Gizmo, X-Geologico and Jeff.
