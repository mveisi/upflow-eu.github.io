We have partnered with the [UCL GeoBus](https://www.geobus-london.org.uk/) to share our work with school children.  GeoBus does fantastic work bringing hands-on workshops to schools around London, inspiring the next generation of Earth scientists!  During our [experiment]({{< ref "experiment" >}}), we will attempt (internet connection permitting!) to have a live Q&A with the children and show them the excitement of a scientific campaign on the Atlantic.
